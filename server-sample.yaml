# LiveKit Helm chart will set up a Deployment, Service, HPA, and Ingress as either
# a single or multi-node LiveKit deployment.
# After installing this chart, you would still need to
# * Open ports on the firewall to the hosts (see https://docs.livekit.io/deploy/ports-firewall)
# * Update DNS of hostnames to the ingress/service that were created
